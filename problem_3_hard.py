    Problem Statement : 
        Given a list of positive integers, return the maximum increasing subsequence, that is, the largest increasing subsequence within the array that has the maximum sum. Examples: if the input is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] then return 5 (since no subsequence is increasing), if the input is [3, 2, 5, 7, 6] return 15 = 3 + 5 + 7, etc.
